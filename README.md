# Transcripto

## üå± Intiative

This initiative was born from a personal challenge I faced while preparing for presentations and interviews. As a non-native speaker, I often need extensive practice, but after speaking in front of a camera, I had no reliable way to review or improve what I had just said.

To solve this, I created a Chrome extension that:

1. Records and converts your speech into text.
2. Enables you to copy the text into AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to get immediate feedback on how to optimize your vocabulary, flow, and tone for any scenario.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error `Microphone access denied`, it means Chrome is blocking access to your microphone until you grant permission. This is a built-in security measure to protect sensitive hardware.

How to fix it:

1. Open Chrome extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
2. Find your `Transcripto` extension in the list.
3. Click the Details button for your extension.
4. On the details page, scroll down until you see a section for `Site access` Click on the link that says Site settings.
5. In the site settings for the extension, find the Microphone row. It will likely show a setting of `Ask` or `Block` Change this setting to `Allow`.
